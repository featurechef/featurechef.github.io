### Data exploration and analysis
#### [Pandemic retail spending](https://github.com/featurechef/notebooks/blob/main/us_retail.ipynb)   
**Brief:** Explored how COVID-19 changed the landscape of US consumer spending within retail trade and food services - for better or for worse. Unfortunate trends emerge in some kinds of business as expected, however much more surprising is the rebound and sustained growth observed in others.  
**Libraries:** `Pandas` and `Seaborn`.
