**Brief:** Explored how COVID-19 changed the landscape of US consumer spending within retail trade and food services - for better or for worse. Unfortunate trends emerge in some kinds of business as expected, however much more surprising is the rebound and sustained growth observed in others.  
**Libraries:** `Pandas` `Seaborn`
